## Telegram WebRTC (VoIP)

```python
from pyrogram import Client, filters
from pyrogram.utils import MAX_CHANNEL_ID

from pytgcalls import GroupCall

app = Client('pytgcalls')
group_call = GroupCall(app, 'input.raw')


@group_call.on_network_status_changed
async def on_network_changed(gc: GroupCall, is_connected: bool):
    chat_id = MAX_CHANNEL_ID - gc.full_chat.id
    if is_connected:
        await app.send_message(chat_id, 'Successfully joined!')
    else:
        await app.send_message(chat_id, 'Disconnected from voice chat..')


@app.on_message(filters.outgoing & filters.command('join'))
async def join(_, message):
    await group_call.start(message.chat.id)


app.run()
```

This project consists of two main parts: [tgcalls](#tgcalls), [pytgcalls](#pytgcalls).
The first is a C++ Python extension. 
The second uses the extension along with Pyrogram.
All together, it allows you to create userbots that can record and 
broadcast in voice chats, make and receive private calls.

### Features

- Python solution.
- Work with voice chats in channels and chats.
- Multiply voice chats ([example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/radio_as_smart_plugin.py)).
- System of custom handlers on events.
- Join as channels or chats.
- Join using invite (speaker) links.
- Speaking status with audio levels inside and outside of voice chat.
- Mute/unmute, pause/resume, stop/play, volume control and more...

### Available sources of input/output data transfers

- File (`GroupCall`, [playout example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/file_playout.py),
  [recording example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/recorder_as_smart_plugin.py))
  — to use any audio files including named pipe (FIFO).
- Device (`GroupCallDevice`, [example](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/device_playout.py)) — to use microphone, headphones, etc.
- Raw (`GroupCallRaw`, [example of restreaming](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/main/examples/restream_using_raw_data.py))
  — to send and receive data in `bytes` directly from Python.

Note: All audio data is transmitted in PCM 16 bit, 48k. 
[Example how to convert files using FFmpeg](#audio-file-formats).

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- A [Telegram API key](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup#api-keys).
- x86_64/arm64 platform and Unix system (use WSL for Windows).


### TODO list
- Incoming and Outgoing calls (already there and working, but not in release).
- Private and group video calls.
- Python binary wheels for Windows
[and more...](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/issues)

### Installing

``` bash
pip3 install pytgcalls -U
```

#### Dev version

``` bash
pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls@dev#subdirectory=pytgcalls
```

## tgcalls 

The first part of the project is C++ extensions for Python. [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
was used to write it. Binding occurs to the [tgcalls](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/tgcalls)
library by Telegram, which is used in all clients. 
To implement the library, the code of official clients (tdesktop and android) was studied.
Changes have been made to the Telegram library. 
All modified code is [available as a subtree](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/tree/main/tgcalls/third_party/lib_tgcalls)
in this repository. The main idea of the changes is to add the ability to play 
from other sources (from a file, for example) and improve the sound quality by making the minimum number 
of code edits for a simple update.
In addition to changes in the Telegram library, a minimal change was made to the WebRTC,
also [available as a subtree](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/tree/main/tgcalls/third_party/webrtc).

### How to build

Short answer for linux:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:MarshalX/tgcalls.git --recursive
cd tgcalls
```
For x86_64:
```bash
docker-compose up tgcalls_x86_64
```
For AArch64 (ARM64):
```bash
docker-compose up tgcalls_aarch64
```

Python wheels will be available in `dist` folder in root of `tgcalls`.

More info:
- [Manylinux](build/manylinux/dev).
- [Ubuntu](build/ubuntu).
- [macOS](build/macos).
- [Windows](build/windows).

Also you can investigate into [manylinux GitHub Actions builds](build/manylinux).

### Documentation

Temporarily, instead of documentation, you can use [an example](pytgcalls/pytgcalls)
along with MTProto.

## pytgcalls 

This project is implementation of using [tgcalls](#tgcalls) 
Python binding together with [MTProto](https://core.telegram.org/mtproto).
A Pyrogram was chosen as a library for working with Telegram Mobile Protocol. 
You can write your own implementation to work with Telethon or other libraries.

### Learning by example

Visit [this page](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/tree/main/examples) to discover the official examples.

### Documentation

`pytgcalls`'s documentation lives at [tgcalls.org](https://tgcalls.org).

### Audio file formats

RAW files are now used. You will have to convert to this format yourself
using ffmpeg. The example how to transcode files from a code is available [here](https://github.com/MarshalX/tgcalls/blob/e0b2d667728cc92cc0da437b9c85bcc909e4ac9c/examples/player_as_smart_plugin.py#L41).

From mp3 to raw (to play in voice chat):
```
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

From raw to mp3 (files with recordings):
```
ffmpeg -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le -i output.raw clear_output.mp3
```

For playout live stream you can use this one:
```
ffmpeg -y -i http://stream2.cnmns.net/hope-mp3 -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

For YouTube videos and live streams you can use youtube-dl:
```
ffmpeg -i "$(youtube-dl -x -g "https://youtu.be/xhXq9BNndhw")" -f s16le -ac 2 -ar 48000 -acodec pcm_s16le input.raw
```

And set input.raw as input filename.
