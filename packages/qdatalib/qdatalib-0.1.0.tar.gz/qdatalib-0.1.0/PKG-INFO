        ### Note this project is under development, and will undergo a massive number of breaking changes

        - better handling of not existing files 
        # Description
        
        QDataLib is a library of wrappers around some of the most useful ”data”-functions in QCoDeS. The Idea of QDataLib is to keep track of your data files using a MongoDB database, and ease the export to other file formats than SQLite
        
        # Installation
        To install QDataLib from source do the following:
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/qdev-dk/QDataLib.git
        $ cd QDataLib
        $ pip install .
        ```
        # Usage
         see [here](https://qdev-dk.github.io/QDataLib/)
        ## Running the tests
        
        If you have gotten 'qdatalib' from source, you may run the tests locally.
        
        Install `qdatalib` along with its test dependencies into your virtual environment by executing the following in the root folder
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install .
        $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Then run `pytest` in the `tests` folder.
        
        ## Building the documentation
        
        If you have gotten `qdatalib` from source, you may build the docs locally.
        
        Install `qdatalib` along with its documentation dependencies into your virtual environment by executing the following in the root folder
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install .
        $ pip install -r docs_requirements.txt
        ```
        
        You also need to install `pandoc`. If you are using `conda`, that can be achieved by
        
        ```bash
        $ conda install pandoc
        ```
        else, see [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for pandoc's installation instructions.
        
        Then run `make html` in the `docs` folder. The next time you build the documentation, remember to run `make clean` before you run `make html`.
