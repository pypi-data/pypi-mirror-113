This package is complementary to the mobile app EpiBOX (available at [EpiBOX](https://github.com/anascacais/rPiInterface)).

Designed for use with Raspberry Pi, it acts as an autonomous recording unit - allowing for sensor connectivity and data storage. EpiBOX mobile app provides the user interaface and the near-real time visualization of the data. 

Currently, EpiBOX supports BITalino-based equipments allowing for the recording, storage and visualization of up to 12 channels simmultaneously. Nevertheless, this package can be easily integrated with other sensors, as long as a python API is provided!
