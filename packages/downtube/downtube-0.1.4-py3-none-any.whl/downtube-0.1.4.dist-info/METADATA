**Most of the time only 360p and 720p videos support audio, so they are recommended over any other resolution**

##### Download video from search terms :

```
dtube dlyt {Search Terms} -r {resolution(optional)}
```

For example:

```
dtube dlyt Despacito_Song -r 360p
```
The first result from your search terms will be downloaded to your current folder

Giving a resolution is completely optional. If you dont provide it, the video will be downloaded in your default resolution.
