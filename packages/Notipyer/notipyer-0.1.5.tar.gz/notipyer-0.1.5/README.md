## Email Notifications
Notipyer currently supports Gmail accounts as senders. To allow the library to use your Gmail account, make the following changes:
   
1. Turn on 2-Step authentication. [Ref](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839)
2. Create an app password. [Ref](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833)
3. While creating an app password, select app as "Other (Custom name)" and enter a name of your choice. 
4. Use the password obtained from app password for the configuration step below.
   
### Configuration
```python
from notipyer.email_notify import set_email_config

SENDER_EMAIL = 'myemail@gmail.com'
SENDER_PASS = 'my_app_password'
set_email_config(SENDER_EMAIL, SENDER_PASS)
```
### Sending Email
```python
from notipyer.email_notify import send_email

subject = 'My Email Subject'
body = 'My Email Body'
to_recipients = ['to-email-1@domain.com', 'toemail2@domain.com'] # Can be None
cc_recipients = ['cc-email-1@domain.com', 'cc-email-2@domain.com'] # Can be None
