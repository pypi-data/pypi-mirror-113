British under General Lake defeated the marATha shiNDe army under ambAjI ingale after a fierce battle. The shiNDe army was sadly not joined by other powers, even marATha ones.

In the days leading up to the battle, Europeans employed by daulatrAv shiNDe to train and lead his army with new tactics treacherously defected to the British- especially the Frenchman Dudrenec and British officers like Smith and Larpent. The brave but less experienced / capable AmbajI had to fill in. Still, the marATha-s were advancing to Delhi before General Lake rushed and caught up.
