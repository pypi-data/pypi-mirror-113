def _mi(x, y, binning_algorithm='EQQ', bins=8, log2=True):
    """Compute mutual information between two time series x and y.

    We use the standard formula
        I(x; y) = sum( p(x,y) * log( p(x,y) / p(x)p(y) ),
    where p(x), p(y) and p(x, y) are probability distributions.

    For that, the probability distributions of both series needs to be
    estimated by some algorithm.

    We can use 'equiquantal binning', i.e. all bins should contain the same
    number of points. Further we can determine, whether the equiquantality is
    forced even if samples with the same value fall into different bins. Or
    whether we ensure that the same value samples fall into the same bin
    (while keeping the bins' sizes as leveled as possible).

    There is also equidistant binning which uses bins of the equal length.

        equidistant binning - algorithm keyword 'EQD'

        (preparing more...)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        The first time series.
    y
        The second time series.
    binning_algorithm
        Algorithm to determine bins for estimation of the distribution.
        Use 'EQQ' for forced equiquantal binning, 'EQQ2' for not-forced
        equiquantal binning (i.e. same values are in the same bin) or 'EQD'
        for equidistant binning.
    bins
        Bins count.
    log2
        Whether log2 will be used over natural logarithm. It determines
        units of the resulting mutual information. Bits for log2, nats for
        natural logarithm.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the name of the binning algorithm is unknown to the method,
        i.e. different from 'EQQ', 'EQQ2', 'EQD'.
