Description: The Precision Syringe Drive (PSD) is a compact syringe pump designed to perform
        all liquid handling operations including dispensing, serial dispensing and diluting.
        There are four types of PSD: 4/6/4 smooth flow/6 smooth flow.
        The intention of this library is to provide a simple form of interaction with the pump.
        The pump is capable to execute various commands, which can be found in the manual. 
        The pyHamiltonPSD library goal is to make this commands easy to be used in a Python environment.
        The library can be used to run commands in the command line, or to create programs that agregate 
        multiple commands as scenarios.
