## StringFix: Brief introduction
StringFix is a python3 toolkit for SNV detection, transcriptome and proteome assembly from RNA-Seq reads.
It takes aligned reads (in SAM or BAM), optionally with genome fasta and its associated GTF, as input(s) and outputs the following.

1. transcript expression profile in tsv format
2. SNV summary in tsv format
3. transcriptome.fasta
4. proteome.fasta

One can import the function by adding a line in your script, i.e., `import StringFix (as sf)`
See stringfix.py for example usage of the package
