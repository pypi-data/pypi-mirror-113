    The method is actually quite slow, but also very safe (e.g. thread safe).

    The algorithm guarantees creation of a unique name by calling
    tempfile.mkstemp(), CLOSING the file and returning its name. Thus,
    the file is created and closed, but also the caller can be sure that no
    race condition when occupying the path.

    Nota that the file with the path is created and is supposed to be
    removed by the caller!

    * the ObjectTempFile is garbage collected,

    * the ObjectTempFileâ€™s dispose() method is called, or
