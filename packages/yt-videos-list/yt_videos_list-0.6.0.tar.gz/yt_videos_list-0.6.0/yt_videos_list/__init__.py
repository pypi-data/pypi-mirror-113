class ListCreator:

    The ListCreator class creates a ListCreator instance with no required arguments.

    #############################################################################################################

    If you ALREADY scraped a channel and the channel uploaded a new video, simply rerun this
    program on that channel and this package updates your files to include the newer video(s)!


    OPTIONAL: Specify the settings you want to use by substituing the desired values for the default arguments.
    An overview is given directly below this, but for a full working example scroll to the bottom.

    Options for the `driver` argument are
      * Firefox (default)
      * Opera
      * Safari (MacOS only)
      * Chrome
      * Brave
      * Edge (Windows only)
        -> driver='firefox'
        -> driver='opera'
        -> driver='safari'
        -> driver='chrome'
        -> driver='brave'
        -> driver='edge'

    Options for the `cookie_consent` argument are
      * False (default) - block all cookie options if prompted by YouTube (at consent.youtube.com)
      * True            - accept all cookie options if prompted by YouTube (also at consent.youtube.com)
          -> cookie_consent=False (default) OR cookie_consent=True

    Options for the file type arguments (`csv`, `txt`, `md`) are
      * True (default) - create a file for the specified type
      * False - does NOT create a file for the specified type
          -> txt=True  (default) OR txt=False
          -> csv=True  (default) OR csv=False
          ->  md=True  (default) OR  md=False

    Options for the `reverse_chronological` argument are
      * True (default) - write the files in order from most recent video to the oldest video
      * False          - write the files in order from oldest video to the most recent video
          -> reverse_chronological=True (default) OR reverse_chronological=False

    Options for the `headless` argument are
      * False (default) - run the driver with an open Selenium instance for viewing
      * True            - run the driver without an open Selenium instance for viewing (runs in "invisible" mode)
          -> headless=False (default) OR headless=True

    Options for the `scroll_pause_time` argument` are any float values greater than 0 (defaults to 0.8)
      * CAUTION: reducing this value too much will result in the program not capturing all the videos,
        so be careful! Experiment :)
      * The value you provide will be how long (in seconds) the program waits before
        trying to scroll the videos list page down for the channel you want to scrape.
      * For fast internet connections, you may want to reduce the value,
        and for slow connections you may want to increase the value.
          -> scroll_pause_time=0.8 (default)

    Options for the `verify_page_bottom_n_times` argument are any int values greater than 0 (defaults to 3)
      * NOTE: this argument is only used when CREATING a new file for a
              new channel, and is unused when UPDATING an existing file for an already scraped channel.
      * The value you provide will be how many times the program needs to verify it acually reached the
        bottom of the page before accepting it is the bottom of the page, and starting to write the information
        to the output file(s).
      * For channels that have uploaded THOUSANDS of videos, increase this value to
        a large number that you think should be sufficient to verify the program reached the bottom of the page.
      * To determine HOW large of a value you should provide, determine the length of time you'd like to wait
        before being reasonably sure that you reached the bottom of the page and it's not just YouTube's server
        trying to fetch the response from an old database entry, and divide the time you decided to wait by the
        scroll_pause_time argument.
          -> For example, if you want to wait 45 seconds and you set the scrioll_pause_time value to 1.0
            -> your_time / scroll_pause_time
            -> 45 / 1.0
            -> 45
            -> therefore: verify_page_bottom_n_times=45
          -> For channels with only a couple hundred videos (or less), the default value of verify_page_bottom_n_times=3
             **should** be sufficient.
      * See commit a68f8f62e5c343cbb0641125e271bb96cc4f0750 for more details.

    Options for the `file_buffering` argument are any int values greater than 0 (defaults to -1, which uses the default OS setting)
      * LEAVE THIS ALONE IF YOU'RE UNSURE!

    WORKING EXAMPLES:

    Minimalist (ListCreator object creates a csv, txt, and md file in reverse chronological order -
    meaning the most recently uploaded videos are at the top of the file):

    lc = ListCreator()


    Minimalist but with a different driver:
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='firefox') # default, argument not required
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='opera')
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='safari')
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='chrome')
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='brave')
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='edge')


    Minimalist in headless ("invisible") mode (NOTE: currently only supported by firefox and chrome):
    -> lc = ListCreator(headless=True)                    # runs firefox in headless mode
    -> lc = ListCreator(driver='chrome', headless=True)   # runs chrome  in headless mode


    Minimalist with reverse chronological order (ListCreator object creates a csv, txt, and md file with
    oldest videos at the top of the file instead of the most recently uploaded videos at the top):
    -> lc = ListCreator(reverse_chronological=False)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Minimalist with longer pauses (useful for slow internet) for channels with a couple hundred videos:
    -> lc = ListCreator(scroll_pause_time=1.2)

    Minimalist with shorter pauses (useful for fast internet) for channels with a couple hundred videos:
    -> lc = ListCreator(scroll_pause_time=0.7)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Minimalist with longer pauses (useful for slow internet) for channels with THOUSANDS of videos:
    -> lc = ListCreator(scroll_pause_time=1.2, verify_page_bottom_n_times=40)

    Minimalist with shorter pauses (useful for fast internet) for channels with THOUSANDS of videos:
    -> lc = ListCreator(scroll_pause_time=0.7, verify_page_bottom_n_times=40)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Only creating a csv file with everything else set to default:
    -> lc = ListCreator(txt=False, md=False)

          You should have no problems if you're updating the files for a channel you've already scraped, but you **might**
          encounter some problems if you're scraping channels for the first time.
          Specifically:
            -> If a channel you're scraping has THOUSANDS of videos, the browser needs to load all the HTML elements
               corresponding to the uploaded videos in memory, so if you have MULTIPLE threads going and all channels
               being concurrently scraped have thousands of videos, your machine might run out of memory!
            -> If you know a channel you're scraping for the first time has THOUSANDS of uploaded videos, it would
               be better to first scrape that channel individually using the `create_list_for(url)` method to create
               the file for that channel, and then use this multi-threaded method to update the file for that channel
               along with files for other channels!
              -> ALSO keep in mind that having many applications running while using yt_videos_list might still cause the
                 program to terminate before reaching the end of the page if your machine's overall memory usage gets too high
                 (look up page faults and memory swap for more information).
            -> NOTE that updating files for channels you've already scraped shouldn't have this problem
               (unless the channel uploaded thousands of videos since the last time you scraped it),
               since the threading overhead and memory required to render a couple hundred HTML video elements
               will be relatively low.
              -> Also note the program stops scrolling when **creating** a new file when new elements can't be loaded in
                 `scroll_pause_time * 2` seconds since the last page scroll, BUT when **updating** an existing file, the
                 program only stops scrolling when it scrolls down to a video that already exists in the file - no matter
                 how long it takes the program to do so (so the program is not required to finding new videos in
                 less than `scroll_pause_time * 2` seconds).
