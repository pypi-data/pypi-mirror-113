Ready to contribute? Please read our Code of Conduct: https://github.com/vintasoftware/entity-embed/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Now, here's how to set up `entity-embed` for local development.

1. Fork the `entity-embed` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/entity-embed.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv entity-embed
    $ cd entity-embed/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. If you're using Conda instead of virtualenv, you must install PyTorch beforehand to have CUDA support::

    $ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.1 -c pytorch -c conda-forge

5. Install dev requirements (either on virtualenv or Conda)::

    $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

6. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

7. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 entity-embed tests
    $ pytest
    $ tox

8. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

9. Submit a Pull Request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a Pull Request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The Pull Request should include tests.
2. If the Pull Request adds functionality, the docs should be updated.
3. The CI should pass.
