# Overview

The featurExtract is python package for bioinformatics. 
The packages contains five subcommands.
The create subcommand is used for creating database.
promoter subcomand is used for extracting promoter sequence.
uORF subcomand is used for extracting upstream open reading frames sequence.
UTR subcomand is used for extracting untranslated region sequence.
CDS subcomand is used for extracting coding sequence.


## Brief introduction of format package

1. **Install** <br>
    ```bash
