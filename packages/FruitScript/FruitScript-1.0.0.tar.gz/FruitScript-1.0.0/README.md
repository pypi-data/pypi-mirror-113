# FruitScript

FruitScript is a module with multiple purposes, file management, on the spot being able to use things and maybe a bunch of useless shit that you don't need, lol. ðŸ˜€

## Installation

`pip install FruitScript`

## Simple Usage

### Importing

Here is a simple way of importing of course.

```py
import ext.FruitScript
from ext.FruitScript import *
```

There is also other useless imports that come from the other files I have like:

```py
import ext.manage
from ext.manage import *
import ext.external
from ext.external import *
```

### Example Code

Here is an example of using FruitScript File Management.

```py
import ext.FruitScript
from ext.FruitScript import fileM

fileM.create('HelloWorld.js') # Creates a file.
fileM.append('HelloWorld.js', 'console.log(\'I am alive.\')') # Appends/Writes/Updates a file with content.
fileM.delete('HelloWorld.js') # Deletes a file.
```

Or possibly the others..

```py
import ext.manage

manage.install() # Installs the FruitScript Module.
```

Or the other functions in ext.manage such as:

``manage.uninstall()`` This will uninstall FruitScript.  
``manage.update()`` This will upgrade FruitScript.

This is the ext.external one.

```py
import ext.external
from ext.external import others

print(others.version()) # Prints out the version number.
print(others.github()) # Prints out the github link.
```
