        # 4. DEFINITICNS OF TERMS 
        
        These definitions, when in lower case, are terms used within this Standard.
        
        They present tenns as specifically used within FORI'H.
        
        # `A`
        
        ## address, byte
        An unsigned number that locates an 8-bit byte in a standard FOR'll! ,; address space over { 0 â€¢â€¢ 65, 535 } â€¢ It may be a native machine address or a representation on a virtual machine; locating the 'addr-th' yte within the virtual byte address space. Address arithmetic is modul.o 65, 536 without overflow.
        
        ## address, compilation
        The numerical value equivalent to a FORTH word definition, which is compi.Led for that definition. The  ddress interpreter uses this value to locate the machine cede corresponding to each definition. (May al. o be called the code field address. ) 
        
        ## address, native ï¿½chine
        The natural address representation of the host computer.
        
        ## address, parameter field
        The address of the first byte of mencry associated with a word definition for the storage of compilation addresses (in a colon-definition), numeric data and text characters. arithmetic All integer arithmetic is performed with signed 16 or 32 bit two's complement results, unless noted.
        
        # `B`
        
        # block
        The unit of data from mass storage, referenced by block number. A block
        must contain 1024 bytes regardless of the minimum data unit read/written
        from mass storage. The translation from block number to device and
        physical reC'Ord is a function of the implementation.
        
        # block buffer
        A menory area where a mass storage block is maintained.
        
        # byte
        An assembly of 8 bi ts. In reference to mencry, it is the storage capa.ci ty
        for 8 bits.
