**pyspbla** is a python wrapper for [spbla](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/spbla) library.

**spbla** is a linear Boolean algebra library primitives and operations for 
work with sparse matrices written for CPU, Cuda and OpenCL platforms. The primary 
goal of the library is implementation, testing and profiling algorithms for
solving *formal-language-constrained problems*, such as *context-free* 
and *regular* path queries with various semantics for graph databases.
The library provides C-compatible API, written in the GraphBLAS style.

**The library** is shipped with python package **pyspbla** - wrapper for
spbla library C API. This package exports library features and primitives 
in high-level format with automated resources management and fancy syntax sugar.

**The primary library primitive** is a sparse boolean matrix. The library provides 
the most popular operations for matrix manipulation, such as construction from
values, transpose, sub-matrix extraction, matrix-to-vector reduce, matrix-matrix
element-wise addition, matrix-matrix multiplication and Kronecker product.  

**As a fallback** library provides sequential backend for mentioned above operations
for computations on CPU side only. This backend is selected automatically
if Cuda/OpenCL compatible device is not presented in the system. This can be quite handy for 
prototyping algorithms on a local computer for later running on a powerful server.   

### Features

- Cuda backend for computations
- OpenCL backend for computations
- Cpu backend for computations
- Matrix creation (empty, from data, with random data)
- Matrix-matrix operations (multiplication, element-wise addition, kronecker product)
- Matrix operations (equality, transpose, reduce to vector, extract sub-matrix)
- Matrix data extraction (as lists, as list of pairs)
- Matrix syntax sugar (pretty string printing, slicing, iterating through non-zero values)
- IO (import/export matrix from/to `.mtx` file format)
- GraphViz (export single matrix or set of matrices as a graph with custom color and label settings)
- Debug (matrix string debug markers, logging)

### Simple example

Create sparse matrices, compute matrix-matrix product and print the result to the output:

```python
import pyspbla as sp

a = sp.Matrix.empty(shape=(2, 3))
a[0, 0] = True
a[1, 2] = True

b = sp.Matrix.empty(shape=(3, 4))
b[0, 1] = True
b[0, 2] = True
b[1, 3] = True
b[2, 1] = True

print(a, b, a.mxm(b), sep="\n")
```

### Transitive closure example

Compute the transitive closure problem for the directed graph and print the result:

```python
import pyspbla as sp

a = sp.Matrix.empty(shape=(4, 4))
a[0, 1] = True
a[1, 2] = True
a[2, 0] = True
a[2, 3] = True
a[3, 2] = True

t = a.dup()                             # Duplicate matrix where to store result
total = 0                               # Current number of values

while total != t.nvals:
    total = t.nvals
    t.mxm(t, out=t, accumulate=True)    # t += t * t

print(a, t, sep="\n")
```

### GraphViz example

Generate GraphViz graph script for a graph stored as a set of adjacency matrices:

```python
import pyspbla as sp

name = "Test"                           # Displayed graph name   
shape = (4, 4)                          # Adjacency matrices shape
colors = {"a": "red", "b": "green"}     # Colors per label

a = sp.Matrix.empty(shape=shape)        # Edges labeled as 'a'
a[0, 1] = True
a[1, 2] = True
a[2, 0] = True

b = sp.Matrix.empty(shape=shape)        # Edges labeled as 'b'
b[2, 3] = True
b[3, 2] = True

print(sp.matrices_to_gviz(matrices={"a": a, "b": b}, graph_name=name, edge_colors=colors))
```

Script can be rendered by any [gviz tool](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) online and the result can be following:
