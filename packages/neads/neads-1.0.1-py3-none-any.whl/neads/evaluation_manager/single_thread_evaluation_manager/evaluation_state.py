    State of evaluation consists of states of individual Activations of an
    SealedActivationGraph represented by DataNodes and arrangement of trigger
    methods in the graph.

    EvaluationState holds of information related to the state of evaluation
    and presents them in convenient form. Also, EvaluationState provides
    methods for alternation of the state (more precisely, DataNode instances
    provide these methods).

    One of the greatest responsibilities performed by the EvaluationState
    itself (not via DataNodes; at least from the user's point of view) is
    invocation of Activations' and graph's trigger methods.

    The trigger methods are called as soon as possible. That is,
    the trigger-on-result is called when the DataNode acquires its data. The
    trigger-on-descendants is called as soon as there is no descendant of the
    DataNode which carries a trigger (i.e. after invocation of last
    descendant's trigger, if it does not introduce new Activation with a
    trigger). Note that if more trigger-on-descendant methods are suitable
    for invocation, one of them is chosen first and its invocation (which
    creates new Activations) may block invocation of the other triggers for
    the moment. Similarly with the graph's trigger.
