That way I\'d be able to define which applications I want to have installed on any new environment, have those under version control, and run a script to install/uninstall applications on any new personal or work computer, server, etc.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goal for appman is to be flexible and extensible. In that context the goals are:\n\n- Cross-platform: handle multiple OS and devices. Currently appman handles Ubuntu and Windows (desktop).\n- Multi-profile: define different profiles with a unique list of applications for different environments (e.g., work and personal computers).\n- Supported Packages: aside from desktop and command line applications, support software like: device drivers, software plugins and extensions (e.g., vscode extensions), backend libraries (e.g., python libraries), fonts, etc.\n- Package Management: support any package manager (e.g., apt, brew, scoop) or custom formulas to define how to install, uninstall and upgrade packages.\n- Buckets: currently there is only [one source](https://github.com/basiliskus/appman/tree/main/appman/buckets/main) to choose packages from, but the idea is to have any user able to create their own buckets which can then be shared and used by other users.\n\n## How to use\n\n### Set up your user package list\n\n- Add a package to your user packages list\n\n  Using interactive mode:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman add\n\n  [?] Select the package type: (Use arrow keys)\n  >app\n   font\n   driver\n   provisioned\n   backend\n   extension\n\n  [?] Select app packages to add: (<up>, <down> to move, <space> to select, <a> to toggle, <i> to invert)\n   ○ curl\n   ○ fzf\n  >● git\n   ○ jq\n   ○ python\n   ○ ...\n\n  Added git package\n  ```\n\n  or directly passing parameters:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman add -pt app -id git\n  ```\n\n- Remove a previously added package\n\n  Using interactive mode:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman remove\n\n  [?] Select the package type: (Use arrow keys)\n  >app\n   font\n   driver\n   provisioned\n   backend\n   extension\n\n  [?] Select app packages to remove: (<up>, <down> to move, <space> to select, <a> to toggle, <i> to invert)\n   ○ 7zip\n   ○ curl\n  >● git\n   ○ ...\n\n  Removed git package\n  ```\n\n  Directly passing parameters:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman remove -pt app -id git\n  ```\n\n- Show your user packages list\n\n  Using interactive mode:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman list\n\n  [?] Select the package type: (Use arrow keys)\n  >app\n\n   • 7zip (cli, utils)\n   • curl (cli, utils)\n  ```\n\n  Directly passing parameters:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman list -pt app\n  ```\n\n- Search all available packages to add\n\n  Using interactive mode:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman search\n\n  [?] Select the package type: (Use arrow keys)\n  >app\n\n  7zip\n  ack\n  apache2\n  aria2\n  bottom\n  broot\n  cookiecutter\n  curl\n  ...\n  ```\n\n  Directly passing parameters:\n\n  ```console\n  $ appman search -pt app -id 7zip\n  ```\n\n### Install/Uninstall packages in your user packages list\n\nUsing interactive mode:\n\n```console\n$ appman install\n\n[?] Select the package type: (Use arrow keys)\n>app\n\nInstalling 7zip...\nInstalling ack...\n...\n```\n\nDirectly passing parameters:\n\n```console\n$ appman install -pt app -id 7zip\n```\n\n### Using labels\n\nAll packages have pre-defined labels (e.g. for apps: \'cli\' & \'gui\'), but you can also add your own labels by passing the --labels/-l parameter to the \'add\' command.\n\n```console\n$ appman add -pt app -id 7zip -l server\n```\n\nYou can also filter by labels when using the \'list\', \'search\', \'remove\', \'install\' or \'uninstall\' commands\n\n```console\n$ appman list -pt app -l server\n```\n\n## License\n\n© Basilio Bogado.
