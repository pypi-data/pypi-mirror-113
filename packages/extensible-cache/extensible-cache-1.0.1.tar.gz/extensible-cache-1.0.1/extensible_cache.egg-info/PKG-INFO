Description: # PythonCache
        
        Simple Library to do Python Caching
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        To install, simply use:
        
        ```
        pip install extensible-cache
        ```
        
        (Planning to add the library to PyPi in the future).
        
        The library is easy to use, just load a cache and provide it some data.
        
        ```python
        import pandas as pd
        from extensible_cache import PandasFileCache
        
        cache = PandasFileCache("./cache_folder")
        df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")
        
        cache["my_cool_data"] = df
        
        # ... somewhere later (even after restart) ...
        
        df_new = cache["my_cool_data"]
        ```
        
        This allows you to quickly buffer data to files and restore them later on.
        
        ## Notes
        
        All contribtions are welcome!
