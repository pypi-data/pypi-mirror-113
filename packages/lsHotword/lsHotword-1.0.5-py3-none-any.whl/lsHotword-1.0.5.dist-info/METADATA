# Welcome to lsHotword

**lsHotoword** detector is Easy to use Module Which is open-Source and **Free License**. ls is stands for **Logical Spot** and this module is created with the help of **Coursera(Andrew Ng)  Program**. If you have any problem you can contact me on my E-mail at the last of this Document. For any Help we also have YouTube channel link is at the last of this file.


# Training Your Own Model

For Training Your Own Model You have to Create Your Dataset.
For example record 10 audio with voice **Activate** and place it under "Positives folder" and record 10 **Non-Activate Word ** Which are not Activate and place it under negatives folder.
and Then run this command
```console 
pip install lsHotword
```
Then go to your python library where **ls Hotword is installed** and run this command.
```
python Htrainer.py --input ./data --epochs 100

```
Here **data** is the folder where both folders **"positives and negatives"** are located and training with 100 epochs.


# Using Trained Model


In the installed directory you find a python file **ls.py** you have to open this file in your code editor and change model path and save it.
Now you had done all things and now go to any directory and create any python file and use this hotword detector like this:

```
import ls
#type any code 
#call your Hotword like this

ls.lsHotword_loop()           #code stoped at this line and resume if you
                         #speak your Wake Word

```
