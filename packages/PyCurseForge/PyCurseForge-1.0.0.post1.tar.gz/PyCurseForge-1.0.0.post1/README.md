# PyCurseForge

A thin Python wrapper around the (hidden) CurseForge API.

> 1.0.0 adds native support for the Minecraft interface, future interfaces planned (or can be PR'd if desired)

See the ``examples`` folder for basic usage of the API.

## Installation
This wrapper is available on PyPI:
```
# Windows
py -3 -m pip install PyCurseForge

# Linux, MacOS or other
pip3 install PyCurseForge
```
Or if you want the development version, install via GitHub (requires ``Git`` to be installed and on PATH):
```
py -3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/XuaTheGrate/PyCurseForge

pip3 install git+https://github.com/XuaTheGrate/PyCurseForge
```
