class DataDefinition:
    """Capture history of the data produced by a function with given arguments.

    The DataDefinition allows you instantly compare results of two calling
    chains (if they are already captured in DataDefinition object) even
    before the results are actually computed, provided that the functions in
    the chains are pure (i.e. their result can be determined solely by their
    arguments).

    The instances are also hashable and works well with pickle module.

    Notes
    -----
        As a 'pure' function we consider those functions which comply with the
        first property in the definition of a pure function on wikipedia.
        That is, when called with the same arguments (here compared by ==)
        the function produces the same results.

        Also, note that the second property might be very important when
        utilizing DataDefinitions. Specially for the purpose of memoization,
        when the function is not actually called and an already computed
        result is returned instead. This might be problematic when used with
        non-pure function, if the surrounding code expects some side effects
        to occur.
