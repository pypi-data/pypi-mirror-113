def method(data_network, surrogate_networks, alpha=0.95, *, weight='weight'):
    """Return the data network with only the significant edges.

    The decision of edge significance goes as follows: first it is computed
    the number of corresponding edges whose weight is at most the weight of
    the data edge. Then, the edge is stays in the graph, if the number of the
    lighter edges divided by the number ALL edges (i.e. surrogates count + 1)
    is at most alpha.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_network : networkx.Graph
        Weighted network created from the true data.
    surrogate_networks : list[networkx.Graph]
        Weighted networks created from the surrogate series. Their nodes must
        correspond to the nodes of the data_network.
    alpha : float
        Proportion of corresponding surrogates edges to surpass for the data
        edge, see the actual decision description above.
    weight
        Attribute to be used as weight.

    Returns

        The data network with only the significant edges.
