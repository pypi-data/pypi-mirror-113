Description: # Demystify
        
        Pen and paper puzzles like Sudoku, Futoshiki and Skyscrapers are hugely
        popular. Solving such puzzles can be a trivial task for modern AI systems.
        However, most AI systems solve problems using a form of backtracking, while
        people try to avoid backtracking as much as possible. This means that
        existing AI systems do not output explanations about their reasoning that
        are meaningful to people.
        
        Demystify is a tool which allows puzzles to be expressed in a high-level
        constraint programming language and uses MUSes to automatically produce
        descriptions of steps in the puzzle solving.
        
        ## Install Instructions
        
        Install conjure (in conjure git checkout):
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure && cd conjure && make && make solvers && make install
        ```
        
        Install some python packages:
        
        ```
        pip3 install python-sat z3-solver numpy sortedcontainers
        ```
        
        Then try:
        
        ```
        python3 demystify --eprime eprime/binairo.eprime --eprimeparam eprime/binairo-1.param
        ```
        
        ## Visualizer
        
        Demystify also has a visual interface, which you can find in a separate repository [here](https://github.com/mmcilree/Demystify-Visualiser)
        
        ## Implemented Puzzles
        
        * Binairo
        * Futoshiki
        * Sudoku
        * Jigsaw Sudoku
        * X-Sudoku
        * [Miracle Sudoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKf9aUIxdb4)

        All the models can be found in the [eprime
        directory](https://github.com/stacs-cp/demystify/tree/master/eprime). If you
        are interested in a puzzle that is not implemented, there is a guide for
        modelling your own puzzles
        [here](https://github.com/stacs-cp/demystify/blob/master/modelling-guide.md).
