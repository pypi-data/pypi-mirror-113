# Calculator
This is a lightweight calculator package for performing simple calculation operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, root, and reset. For each operation, it takes only one input number and combines it with the current value in the calculator memory. The memory value can be reset at any time.

## Features

- Addition : Adds input value to memory value
- Subtraction : Subtracts input value from memory value
- Multiplication : Multiplies input value by memory value
- Division : Divides input value by memory value
- Root : Returns the input value root of the memory value
- Reset : Resets memory value to zero

## Sample Usage 
 
This calculator always uses the memory value as the start value, remember to reset to start a new calculation. For example: 
> - 2 + 3 -- Will start by running add 2, then add 3
> - 4 - 2 -- Will start by running add 4, then subtract 2
> - 2 * 5 -- Will start by running add 2, then multiply 5
> - 6 * 3 -- Will start by running add 6, then divide 3
> - 3âˆš4 -- Will start by running add 4, then root 3

Usage example for each method is given below

```shell
from calculator.calculator import Calculator
calculator = Calculator()

$ calculator.add(5)

$ calculator.subtract(3)

$ calculator.multiply(3)

$ calculator.divide(3)

$ calculator.root(2)

$ calculator.reset()
```
