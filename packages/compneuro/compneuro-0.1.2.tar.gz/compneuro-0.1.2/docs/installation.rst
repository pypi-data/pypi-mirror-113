need to install NodeJS with version greater than :code:`14.0` to make sure that the
custom `Bokeh` 3d plotting capability renders correctly in Jupyter. For installing
NodeJS_, you should follow instructions on their official website.

Stable release
--------------

To install :code:`CompNeuro`, run this command in your terminal:
