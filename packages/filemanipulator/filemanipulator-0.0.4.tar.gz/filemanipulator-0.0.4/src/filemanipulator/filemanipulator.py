        wraplength (int): The number of characters each line of information should be, before\na line break is inserted.\n
                            Default is infinite, and should be left blank if custom line breaks are used.
        directory (str): The directory that the file should be created in. (default current directory).

                                be sanitised. Each entry counts as a character and must be entirely
                                within the file name to be sanitised. Case sensitive.
                                Example: bannedcharacters = ["foo", "bar"]. "foo" will be removed from
                                foofile.txt, but not foba.txt or Foo.txt. "bar" will not be removed from

    Reads a chosen file in a directory using readlines

    Reads a chosen file in a directory using readlines,
    and returns a list containing each line. Can execute 
    procedures stored in 'actions', when the correlating
    index actiontrigger is read. To have several procedures
    trigger in succession per action trigger, a nested list
    should be used (see below). Newlines are removed.
    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file to be read. Sanitised automatically for banned characters. Must include the extension.
        directory (str): The directory to access.
                    (default current directory)
        
        readfrom (str): Information will be read from this point on (inclusive)
        readto (str): Information will be read up to this point (exclusive)
        totalreadmatch (str): Whether the file text must exactly match the readfrom/to points for reading to be affected.
            "none" does not use this, "word" for the entire word to match and "line" for the entire line to match.
        casesensitivestartstop (bool): Whether the readfrom/to should be case sensitive.

        lines (int): The number of lines to read

        mustbereadingtriggers(bool): Whether triggers only activate after readfrom and before readto.

        actiontriggers (list): The strings that will cause the procedure in the
            correlating index for the 'actions' list to be called. Must be an exact match,
            although case sensitivity is controlled by the casesensitivetriggers arg.
            If 'totalmatch' is "word", the action trigger will only work if a word is only
            comprised of the action trigger. If 'totalmatch' is "line", the action trigger
            will only work if the entire line is composed of the action trigger.
            REPEAT HANDLING: If triggers are repeated, only the first instance of the
            trigger (and its actions) will be used, and further instances are ignored.

        actions (list): The procedures that should be called when action triggers
            are read. Example: actiontriggers = ["foo"], and actions = [myFunc1], where
            myFunc1 does: print("foobar"). Whenever "foo" is read in the file, "foobar"
            will print, as myFunc1 is called. Partials should be used to parse procedures
            requiring arguments - the functions are treated in the same way as tKinter button commands.
            If "stop" or "s" is inserted as a function at any point, the reading will stop and the
            current read information will be returned as is. Alternatively, the current data
            can be yielded as part of an iterator using "yield" or "y". These are the only string-based
            command available (for the time being).
        totalmatch (bool): Controls whether an action trigger only triggers its action(s) when an entire word is comprised of one of the action triggers ("word"), or an entire line ("line"). Defaults to "none", where any character sequence match
            will trigger an action. Example: "foo" in "foobar" will trigger for "none", 
            "foo" in "foo in a sentence." will trigger for "word", and "foo" will trigger for
            a "foo" on its own line (disregarding line breaks)
        bannedcharacters (list): The characters sanitised against in the file name
        encoding (str): The encoding to read the file with (default "utf-8")
        skipempties (bool): Whether empty lines should be returned
    Returns:
        list: A list containing a string per element for each line
    
    Raises:

    Transcribes text from one file to another.

    Transcribes text from one file to another, with specified start and
    end points, either numerical (number of characters), or from a given
    instance of a specific character/word/line. Out of startpoint, endpoint
    and numberofchars, if they are used, only 2 must be supplied, and the third
    can be automatically calculated. If the startchar naturally exceeds the endchar
    due to instance variables being set, they will automatically be swapped.
    
    Args:
        sourcefile (str): The file (including directory) from which data is transcribed.
        targetfile (str): The file (including directory) to which data is transcribed.
        startpoint (int): The start point of transcription, as the number of characters
                    from the file start point. If this is supplied, only one of endpoint or
                    numberofchars must be supplied for the transcription to work (if an end
                    point is desired)
        endpoint (int): The end point - number of characters from the file start point.
        startchar (str): The string to start reading from (inclusive)
        endchar (str): The string to stop reading from (inclusive)
        numberofchars (int): The number of chars that should be read from the start point.
        charinstance1 (int): The instance of a startchar that should be obeyed first - defuaults to the first
                        instance. Zero-indexed. For example, if charinstance1 = 3, the reading will only start
                        from the 4th instance of the startchar (the 4th "foo" if startchar = "foo")
        charinstance2 (int): The instance of an endchar that should be obeyed first - defuaults to the first
                        instance. Zero-indexed. For example, if charinstance2 = 3, the reading will only start
                        from the 4th instance of the endchar (the 4th "foo" if endchar = "foo")
        casesensitive (bool): Whether the matches to start/end chars and the file contents must be case sensitive (default True)
        chunking (bool): Whether file lines should be chunked to avoid memory errors on large files with long lines.
                    Takes more time but reduces memory usage. Cannot be used with charinstances, and takes priority over them.
        chunksize (int): The number of bytes each line chunk should be, if chunking is used. Defaults to 1000000 (1 MB)
        encoding (str): The file encoding to use. (default utf-8)
        createsecondfile (bool): Whether the second, target file should be created (even if it exists already - see overwrite args).
        overwrite (bool): Whether currently existing files akin in name to the target file being created should be overwritten.
        overwritechars (str): The string to append to the name of the new file if it cannot overwrite other files, so that it has a unique name.
        readbinary (bool): Whether the information read should be binary.
        writebinary (bool): Whether the information written should be binary.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the writing was successful.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the endpoint is greater than the start point, or the number of chars is less than 1.
