        copy
            Whether a deep copy of given objects should appear in the
            resulting arguments.

            It is safer to create the copy to prevent intertwining between
            the original objects and the objects in the arguments. The
            modification of non-copied objects may result in unexpected
            behavior.
        share
            Object should be shared among all replacements for the particular
            Symbol. It depends on the `copy` argument, whether it will be the
            original object, or its copy.
            If `share` is False, each replacement of the Symbol have its
            own deepcopy of the original object.

            This argument is considered only if `copy` is True.

            Also note that in case of `copy` and `share` being True,
            one object won't be shared among occurrences of different Symbols
            (although the identical object were passed as a substitution for
            both Symbols). To arrange this behavior, one must perform
            a substitution of those Symbols first.

        Returns
        -------
            Object described by the SymbolicObject.

        Raises
        ------
        SymbolicObjectException
            If there are still some Symbols left in the SymbolicObject.

        Notes
        -----

            * `get_value` accepts any object

            Remaining Symbols:
            * When calling `get_value`, all Symbols must be substituted
            * When calling `substitute`, some Symbols may remain

            * When using `substitute` (and `get_value` later), objects must
