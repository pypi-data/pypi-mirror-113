        The evaluation has two steps.
        First, the algorithm must evaluate all 'objective nodes' (property of
        ES), more precisely gets them to MEMORY state (either by evaluation or
        load from database).
        Then, the algorithm must get data from all 'result nodes' which are

        ----------
        evaluation_state
            Instance of evaluation state, whose graph is evaluated.

        -------
            Dictionary which maps childless Activations of the graph to their
