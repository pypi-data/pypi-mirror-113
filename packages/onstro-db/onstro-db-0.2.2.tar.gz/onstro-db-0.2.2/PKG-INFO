        ## 📚 tl;dr
        
        A simple code snippet on how to use OnstroDB
        
        ```python
        from onstrodb import OnstroDb
        
        # define the schema for the DB
        db_schema = {
            "name": {"type": "str", "required": True},
            "age": {"type": "int", "required": True},
            "place": {"type": "str", "default": "canada"}
        }
        
        # initialize the db
        db = OnstroDb(db_name="test-db", schema=db_schema)
        
        db.add([
            {"name": "adwaith", "age": 16},
            {"name": "fred", "age": 17, "place": "texas"}
        ])
        db.commit()
        
        ```
        
        ## ❓ Why use it ?
        
        We all know that [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is fast, but it's also really hard to learn for beginners. That's where OnstroDb comes into action. This DB allows you to perform CRUD operations on data, with the speed promised by Pandas. Without you having to know a single thing about pandas. The DB is also strict.,i.e once the schema and the types of the data are defined it cannot be modified. And it also comes with a CLI.
