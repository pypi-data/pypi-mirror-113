    The extractor is an ActivationGraph with 3 inputs, the first for the data
    of the Activation which served as input to the separator (i.e. the
    `parent_activation` in create method), the second for data of separator
    and the last for index to the data. The extractor has, as usual,
    one result Activation which is considered to be the result of step's
    choice. That is, step's choices results are the result Activation of
    attached extractors (i.e. they are added as children of the
    `parent_activation` to the TreeView and the next steps are attached to
    them).

        ----------
        graph
            The graph which represent the operations of the extractor.
            It has three inputs and one result Activation (i.e. single childless

        ------
        ValueError

        ----------
        target_graph

        data_activation
            The Activation which serves as a data source for the extractor.

            The Activation which serves as a instruction source for the

        instruction_index
            Index of the instruction designated for the attached copy
