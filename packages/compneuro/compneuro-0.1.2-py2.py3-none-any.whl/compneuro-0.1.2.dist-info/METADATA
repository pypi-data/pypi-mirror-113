This Module provides source code for Book Chapters and Notebooks for 4020.

Features
--------

* Utility functions for signal generation, spectral analysis, spike plotting, and other plotting functionalities
* CPU-based simulation and analysis of dynamical system models
* Interactive plotting of results using Bokeh.


Installation
------------

To install the lastest version on PyPI, run the following code:

.. code::

        pip install compneuro

This will install all the necessary requirements as specified in the `setup.py` file.
However, you will
need to install NodeJS with version greater than :code:`14.0` to make sure that the
custom `Bokeh` 3d plotting capability renders correctly in Jupyter. For installing
NodeJS_, you should follow instructions on their official website.

For development, see below.

Development
-----------
Make sure you install NodeJS_ first. Afterwards, you can install the package
including the requirements by executing::

        pip install -e .[dev]

If you want to work on distributing the package, you will need to install a few
additional packages, which can be done by running::

        pip install -e .[dist]

Before committing, use black_ to format the python code by running

.. code::

        black compneuro

For each utility function added, make sure you add a test function in the
`compneuro/tests` folder. All tests should be written using pytest_.

You can also run all tests by running:

.. code::

        py.test
