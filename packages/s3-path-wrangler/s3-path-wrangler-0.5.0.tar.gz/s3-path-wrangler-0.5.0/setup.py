Afterwards, run `poetry install` to create a virtualenv and install all dependencies.\n\n[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) is used (and enforced via workflows) to format all code. Poetry will install it\nautomatically, but running it is up to the user. To format the entire project, run `black .`.\n\nTo run tests, either activate the virtualenv via `poetry shell` and run `pytest ./tests`,\nor simply run `poetry run pytest ./tests`.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis project uses the Apache 2.0 license and is maintained by the data science team @ Barbora. All contribution are \nwelcome in the form of PRs or raised issues.\n',
