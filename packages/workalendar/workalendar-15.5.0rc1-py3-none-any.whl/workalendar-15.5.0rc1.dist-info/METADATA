# Workalendar

## Overview

Workalendar is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars, list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation functions.

## Status

This library is ready for production, although we may warn eventual users: some calendars may not be up-to-date, and this library doesn't cover all the existing countries on earth (yet).

If you spot any bug or wish to add a calendar, please refer to the [Contributing doc](docs/contributing.md).

## Usage sample

```python
>>> from datetime import date
>>> from workalendar.europe import France
>>> cal = France()
>>> cal.holidays(2012)
[(datetime.date(2012, 1, 1), 'New year'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 4, 9), 'Easter Monday'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 1), 'Labour Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 8), 'Victory in Europe Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 17), 'Ascension Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 5, 28), 'Whit Monday'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 7, 14), 'Bastille Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 8, 15), 'Assumption of Mary to Heaven'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 11, 1), "All Saints' Day"),
 (datetime.date(2012, 11, 11), 'Armistice Day'),
 (datetime.date(2012, 12, 25), 'Christmas')]
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 25))  # it's Christmas
False
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 30))  # it's Sunday
False
>>> cal.is_working_day(date(2012, 12, 26))
True
>>> cal.add_working_days(date(2012, 12, 23), 5)  # 5 working days after Xmas
datetime.date(2012, 12, 31)
```

## External dependencies

**Workalendar will require you to use Python 3.6+.**

Workalendar is tested on Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and on Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS and Windows using Github actions.

### Conditional dependencies

As of v15.0.0:

* If you're using \*Nix and Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, the package `backports.zoneinfo` is required
* If you're using Windows and Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, the package `tzdata` is *also* a requirement (with the `backports.zoneinfo`).
* If you're using Python 3.9+, the stdlib `zoneinfo` package will be used.

## Caveats

Please take note that some calendars are not 100% accurate. The most common example is the Islamic calendar, where some computed holidays are not exactly on the same official day decided by religious authorities, and this may vary country by country. Whenever it's possible, try to adjust your results with the official data provided by the adequate authorities.

## History

This project was born in 2013, as an answer to the question "how do we calculate *this date + 5 working days*?". It was a use-case for [PeopleDoc](https://www.people-doc.fr/), in their ticketing application, for calculating SLAs. And it began as a small open-source library, for France and the USA at first.

Thanks to PeopleDoc, this project grew and eventually became a world-wide library, with the help of dozens of contributors.

As of June 2021, this project has moved to its own organization.
