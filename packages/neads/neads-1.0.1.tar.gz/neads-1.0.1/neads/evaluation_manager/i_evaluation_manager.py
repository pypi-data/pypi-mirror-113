    EvaluationManager is responsible for evaluating given
    SealedActivationGraph. The evaluation usually involves evaluation of
    individual nodes, loading and saving their data to a Database, memory
    management etc. For more info on evaluation see `evaluate` method.

    Only SealedActivationGraphs may be evaluated, as their Activations
    (SealedActivations) possess DataDefinition. For simplification, we use
    the name Activation and ActivationGraph for SealedActivation and
    SealedActivationGraph in the context of EvaluationManager.

        ----------
        activation_graph
            The graph to be evaluated. Note that it may be changed
