Can be installed using pip and depends on git to work properly.\n\n```bash\npip install rhasspy-skills-cli\n```\n# Install new skill\nTo install a new skill is very simple, you just need to specify the name. \n```bash\nrhskill install time_examples\n```\nThe application will clone the repositories passed with the flag "--repositories" by default will use the [examples repository](https://github.com/razzo04/rhasspy-skills-examples.git) and then will search for the skill with the corresponding name. You can also install a local directory or tar archive which contains the manifest.json. \n\n# Create new skill\nTo easily create a new skill you can use the sub-command create. If you pass the flag "-i", which stand for "--interactive", it will ask a series of prompt for helping the creation of the manifest.json.\n```bash\nrhskill create -i\n```\nYou can also specify which template to use, in this way will be generated a functional skill based on the selected template. For now, the template simple consists of overwriting the manifest.json of a working skill but in the future will be added new functionality. Once as be created you can test by using:\n```bash\nrhskill install path/to/skill\n```',
