# BossWeb
A GUI framework that uses web technologies (html, css and javascript) for developing desktop and web apps. It is similar to flexx but differs in the sense that it uses QtWebEngineView as a renderer to make proper GUI apps in Qt using web technologies. Brython is used for developing the frontend (to replace the Javascript).
