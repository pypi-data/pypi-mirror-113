    Parameters
    ----------
        Sequence which uniquely describes the ResultTree which is
        the result of SCM's evaluation (i.e. of the graph created by SCM).
        The list contain one entry for each node in the tree. The
        entries are in BFS order.
        Each entry consists of a dictionary, which contains the number of
        node's children (to determine the tree shape) under key
        'child_count'. For some nodes, the dictionary also contain key
        'data' with symbol of the appropriate Activation (i.e. the one
        that corresponds to the node in the TreeView).

    Returns
    -------
        Instance of ResultTree whose shape corresponds to the given
        `structure_description`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If there is a mismatch between declared number of children and length
        of the description. That is, the sum of 'child_count' values is
        different from the length of the description - 1.
