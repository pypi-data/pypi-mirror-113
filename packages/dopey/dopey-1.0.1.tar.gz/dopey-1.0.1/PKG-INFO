        Dopey is a brainf\*ck interpreter. It fully implements all the features of brainf\*ck as defined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck#Language_design).

        ## Implemetation Limitations
        
        Dopey is limited to a memory buffer of **30,000** byte cells all initialized to zero. Any attempts to move the pointer past the bounds of the memory buffer will result in an exception being raised. Attempting to print any cell with a value outside of the defined ASCII characters may also result in an exception.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Make sure you've installed Python 3. You can download and install Python 3 at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        
        Verify you have Python 3 installed by running the following:
        
        ```bash
        python --version
        ```
        or in some systems
        ```bash
        python3 --version
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        
        You can install dopey using `pip`. From the command line:
        
        ```bash
        # use pip python package manager to install dopey
        $ pip install dopey
        
        # run dopey using python
        $ python -m dopey my-bf-file.bf
        ```
        
        You can also import an interpreter class included with dopey and use it in your own python scripts.
        
        ```python
        from dopey import Interpreter
        
        interpreter = Interpreter()
        interpreter.execute("[brainf*ck code]++-->><<++--")
        ```
