        The decision for each node (whether it suits the query) goes as
        follows. If the query has different length than the node's
        name, the node is not included.
        Otherwise, when the query is as long as the node's name, we compare
        the the query and the node's name entry by entry.
        If there is an index on which the sequence has an integer which
        differs from name's one (name is sequence of integers), the node is not
        included.
        That is, each integer in the query masks out all node's with
        different integer on the index. On the other hand, the None works
        as wildcard, i.e. with the meaning 'no restriction'.

        data
