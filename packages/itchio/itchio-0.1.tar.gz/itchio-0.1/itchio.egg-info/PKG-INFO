Description: # itchio-lib
        Since I didn't find one, I made it on my own.
        
        ## Purpose
        Use the REST-API of itch.io in python in a simple way
        
        ## Examples
        ```py
        import itchio
        
        session = itchio.Session("1234")
        #                        ^
        #                        This is your API-key
        
        userCollection = itchio.UserCollection(session)
        
        me = userCollection.me()
        
        print(me.username)
        ```
        ```
