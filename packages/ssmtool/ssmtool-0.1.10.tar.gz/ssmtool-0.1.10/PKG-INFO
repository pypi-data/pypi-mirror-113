# Simple Sentence Mining
Simple Sentence Mining (`ssmtool`) is a program for sentence mining, in which sentences with target vocabulary words are collected and added into a spaced repetition system (SRS) for language learning.

This program monitors your clipboard at all times and when a change is detected, the contents gets copied onto the "Sentence" field. From there, you can double click any word, and the program will send a query to Wiktionary, and display the result on the "Definition" field, while simultaneously filling in the "word" field for you. You may also double click from words in the "Definition" field to get definition, because Wiktionary sometimes simply lists the base forms of inflected words.
