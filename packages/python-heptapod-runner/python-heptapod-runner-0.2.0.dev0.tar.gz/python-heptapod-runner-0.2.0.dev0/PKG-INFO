Description: # Python utilities and subsytems for Heptapod Runner
        
        [Heptapod Runner](https://foss.heptapod.net/heptapod/heptapod-runner)
        is the fork of [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) meant to
        work for [Heptapod](https://heptapod.net) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
        instances.
        
        The facilities provided in this package are part of the Heptapod Runner
        extended distribution, aiming to provide additional options. They also
        share the same
        [source code repository](https://foss.heptapod.net/heptapod/heptapod-runner)
        with Heptapod Runner.
        
        They are not to be confused with the main Heptapod Runner program, which
        is a standalone programm written in Go (like GitLab Runner) that does not have
        any dependency on `python-heptapod-runner`.
        
        Python was selected for fast prototyping and because it is lingua franca in
        the Mercurial community, but It is possible that some of facilities end up
        being rewritten in another language.
