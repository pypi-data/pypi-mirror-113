Creating a Ballet project
-------------------------

You and your hundred smartest colleagues want to collaborate on a feature engineering project. How
will you organize your work? You are in the right place to learn. With the Ballet framework,
contributors to your project will write self-contained feature engineering source code. Then,
Ballet will take care of the rest: submitting proposed features as pull requests to your GitHub
repository, carefully validating the proposed features, and combining all of the accepted features
into a single feature engineering pipeline.

In this section, we will describe how the Ballet framework can be leveraged for your project, which
we will call ``myproject``.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before creating the project, the maintainer must have a training dataset used for developing
features and details about the prediction problem they are ultimately trying to solve.

Then, :doc:`install Ballet </installation>` on your development machine.

Project instantiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To instantiate a project, use the ``ballet quickstart`` command. (You may want to :ref:`look ahead<maintainer_guide:Automatic repository creation>` and see `what options <cli_reference.html#ballet-quickstart>`__ are available for this command, such as for automatically creating a GitHub repository for the project.):

.. literalinclude:: fragments/maintainer-guide/ballet-quickstart.txt
   :language: console

This command uses `cookiecutter`_ to render a project template using information supplied by the
project maintainer. The resulting files are then committed to a new git repository. Note that the
specification of a scorer for the not-chosen problem type can be skipped (by selecting ``n/a``).

Let's see what files have we have created:

.. literalinclude:: fragments/maintainer-guide/tree-project.txt
   :language: console

Importantly, by keeping this project structure intact, Ballet will be able to automatically care
for your feature engineering pipeline.

* ``ballet.yml``: a Ballet configuration file, with details about the prediction problem, the
  training data, and location of feature engineering source code.
* ``.travis.yml``: a `Travis CI`_ configuration file pre-configured to run a Ballet validation
  suite.
* ``src/myproject/api.py``: this is where Ballet will look for functionality implemented by your
  project, including a function to load training/test data or collected features. Stubs for this
  functionality are already provided by the template but you can further adapt them.

Project installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For local development, you can then install your project. This will make your feature
engineering pipeline accessible in interactive settings (Python interpreter, Jupyter notebook)
and as a command-line tool.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ballet-my-project
   $ conda create -n myproject -y && conda activate myproject  # or your preferred environment tool
   (myproject) $ pip install invoke && invoke install

Collaboration via git and GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under the hood, contributors will collaborate using the powerful functionality provided by git
and GitHub. In fact, after the quickstart step, you will already have a git-tracked repository and a
git remote set up.

.. literalinclude:: fragments/maintainer-guide/git-log.txt
   :language: console

Automatic repository creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The matching remote repository on GitHub must be created. This can be done automatically by the quickstart command by passing the ``--create-github-repo`` flag. This causes Ballet to use the GitHub API to create a repository under the account of the ``github_owner`` that you specified earlier (in this case, ``jane_developer``), and then push the local repository to GitHub. You must provide a GitHub access token with the appropriate permissions, either by exposing the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable, or by passing it to the quickstart command using the ``--github-token`` option. See more details on these options `here <cli_reference.html#ballet-quickstart>`__.

Manual repository creation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternately, you can manually create the repository on GitHub. Do not
initialize the project with any sample files that GitHub offers. Once you do this, push your local copy.

.. code-block:: console

   $ git push --all origin


Enabling continuous integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ballet makes uses of the continuous integration service `Travis CI`_ in order to validate code
that contributors propose as well as perform streaming feature definition selection. You must
enable Travis CI for your project on GitHub by `following these simple directions
<https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci-using-github>`__. You can
skip any steps that have to do with customizing the ``.travis.yml`` file, as we have already done
that for you in the quickstart.

Installing bots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many Ballet project use bots to assist maintainers.

1. Ballet bot. Install it `here <https://github.com/apps/ballet-bot>`__. Ballet bot will
automatically merge or close PRs based on the CI test result and the project settings configured
in the ``ballet.yml`` file.

2. Repolockr. Install it `here <https://github.com/apps/repolockr>`__. Repolockr checks every PR
to ensure that "protected" files have not been changed. These are files listed in the Repolockr
config file on the master branch. A contributor might accidentally modify a protected file like
``ballet.yml`` which could break the project or the CI pipeline; Repolockr will detect this and
fail the PR which might accidentally pass otherwise.

Configuring the project
-----------------------

Ballet allows you to configure many aspects of your project.

Configuration is stored in the project root ``ballet.yml`` file. More details about project configuration will be added soon.

Here is an incomplete list of configuration options, identified by the dotted keys from a root ``config`` object:

* ``config.validation.project_structure_validator``: fully-qualified name of the class used to validate changes to the project structure
* ``config.validation.feature_api_validator``: fully-qualified name of the class used to validate the feature API of new features
* ``config.validation.feature_accepter``: fully-qualified name of the class used to validate the ML performance of new features
* ``config.validation.feature_pruner``: fully-qualified name of the class used to prune existing features with respect to their ML performance
* ``config.validation.split``: the name of the data split used for validating contributions. It will be passed as a keyword argument to your ``load_data`` function, i.e. ``load_data(split=split)``. This split should probably appear under the list at ``config.data.splits``.

Developing new features
-----------------------

At this point, your feature engineering pipeline contains no features. How will your
contributors add more?

Using any of a number of development workflows, contributors write new features and submit them
to your project for validation. For more details on the contributor workflow, see :doc:`/contributor_guide`.

Validating features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ballet-my-project`` repository has received a new pull request which triggers an automatic
evaluation.

1. The PR is examined by the CI service.
2. The ``ballet validate`` command is run, which validates the proposed feature contribution using
   functionality within the ``ballet.validation`` package.
3. If the feature can be validated successfully, the PR passes, and the proposed feature can be
   merged into the project.

Pruning features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once a feature has been accepted and merged into your project's master branch, it may mean that
an older feature has now become "redundant": the new feature is providing all of the information
contained in the old feature, and more.

1. Each commit to master is examined by the CI service.
2. The ``ballet validate`` command is run and automatically determines whether the commit is a
   merge commit that comes from merging an accepted feature.
3. If so, then the set of existing features is pruned to remove redundant features.
4. Pruned features are automatically deleted from your source repository by an automated service.

Updating the framework
----------------------

If there are updates to the Ballet framework after you have started working on your project, you
can access them easily.

First, update the ``ballet`` package itself using the usual ``pip`` mechanism:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install --upgrade ballet

Pip will complain that the upgraded version of ballet is incompatible with the version required
by the installed project. That is okay, as we will presently update the project itself to work
with the new version of ballet.

Next, use the updated version of ``ballet`` to incorporate any updates to the "upstream" project
template used to create new projects.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ballet update-project-template --push

This command will re-render the project template using the saved inputs you have provided in the
past and then safely merge it first to your ``project-template`` branch and then to your
``master`` branch. Finally, given the ``--push`` flag it will push updates to
``origin/master`` and ``origin/project-template``. The usage of this command is described in more
detail `here <cli_reference.html#ballet-update-project-template>`__.
