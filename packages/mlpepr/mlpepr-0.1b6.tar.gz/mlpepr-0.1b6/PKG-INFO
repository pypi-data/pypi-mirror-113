ML-PePR: Pentesting Privacy and Robustness
==========================================

ML-PePR stands for Machine Learning Pentesting for Privacy and Robustness and is a Python library for evaluating machine
learning models. PePR is easily extensible and hackable. PePR's attack runner allows structured pentesting, and the
report generator produces straightforward privacy and robustness reports (LaTeX/PDF) from the attack results.

**Caution, we cannot guarantee the correctness of PePR. Always do check the plausibility of your results!**

Installation
------------

To install pepr use ``pip install mlpepr``.
