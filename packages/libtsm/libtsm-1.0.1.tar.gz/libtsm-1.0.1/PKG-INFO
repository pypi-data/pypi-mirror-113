        ## Installation
        
        With Python >= 3.6, you can install libtsm using the Python package manager pip:
        
        ```
        pip install libtsm
        ```
        
        ## Documentation
        
        The API documentation of `libtsm` is hosted here:

        ## Contributing
        
        We are happy for suggestions and contributions. However, to facilitate the synchronization, we would be grateful for either directly contacting us via email (meinard.mueller@audiolabs-erlangen.de) or for creating [an issue](https://github.com/meinardmueller/libtsm/issues) in our GitHub repository. Please do not submit a pull request without prior consultation with us.
        
        If you want to report an issue with libtsm or seek support, please use the same communication channels (email or GitHub issue).
        
        ## Tests
        
        Central to our tests is the comparison of `libtsm` with the MATLAB TSM Toolbox.
        To this end, please execute `tests/test_matlab.m` in MATLAB to create the MATLAB output.
        Then, you can use [pytest](https://pytest.org) for executing our Python test scripts. `pytest` is available when installing libtsm with the extra requirements for testing.
        
        ```
        pip install 'libtsm[tests]'
        pytest
        ```
