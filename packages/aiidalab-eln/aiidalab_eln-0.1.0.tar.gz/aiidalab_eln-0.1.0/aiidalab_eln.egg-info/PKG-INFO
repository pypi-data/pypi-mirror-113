# AiiDAlab-ELN

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-eln/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aiidalab/aiidalab-eln/actions/workflows/pre-commit.yml)

Integrate AiiDAlab with Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN). This repository implements a general API for interfacing AiiDAlab with some ELN and a concrete implementation for the integration with the [cheminfo ELN](cheminfo.github.io/).

## AiiDAlab-Cheminfo ELN implementation

As a first prototype we implemented an integration with the open-source [cheminfo ELN](cheminfo.github.io/).
The ELN and integration can be tested via the [public deployment of the ELN](c6h6.org). Documentation on how to use the frontend can be found [here](docs.c6h6.org).
